Technical Demo of UIKit using Alamofire, Realm, and MVVM

This is an app made to show the technical capabilities of UIKit in the modern day.

The apps features are searching through the app store and viewing an app with offline functionality.

Frameworks Used:

UI - UIKit,
Architecture - MVVM,
Networking - Alamofire,
Data Persistence - RealmSwift,
Image Caching - Kingfisher,
Testing - Quick and Nimble

Room for improvement:

Unfortunately Due to time constraints, I wasn't able to get Mockable working for more robust unit tests. Specifically mocking closure returns.
While RealmSwift is Legacy, I would like to study GRDB.

Overall I enjoyed problem solving this and would revisit it or showcase it as a proof of concept.
